Android + webservice = magic!

Download the [example app on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.leocad.dumbledoreexample) to see it in action!

##Current version
1.0 (20130227)

*Android Studio / Maven users*: `'io.leocad:dumbledroid:1.0'`

*Eclipse users*: download the binary here: [dumbledroid-1.0.jar](http://static.leocad.io/dumbledroid-1.0.jar).

*Eclipse plugin*: install it using the update site: [http://leocad.io/dumbledroidplugin/](http://leocad.io/dumbledroidplugin/). Learn how to install the plugin [here](https://github.com/leocadiotine/Dumbledroid/wiki/Installing-eclipse-plugin).

##Purpose
Dumbledroid is a framework that enables integration between an Android app and a RESTful server using magic. ~~Actually, it's not real magic. I'm kidding.~~

Using Dumbledroid, the developer doesn't have to write parsers for JSON or XML documents from a web service. It maps the document nodes to the class fields and does this automagically!

Dumbledroid also does automatic caching in memory and in disk. *Presto!*

##Origin of the name
Dumbledroid was named after the wizard [Dumbledore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbledore), a ~~blatant copy of Gandalf~~ major character of the *Harry Potter* series.

##How it works
This framework gets the names of the JSON/XML nodes and uses [reflection](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.html) to find out the names of the class fields. Then, it maps the value of the first to the second.

It also adds non-intrusive memory caching using [SoftReferences](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/ref/SoftReference.html), i.e., when the garbage collector needs the memory, it is freed. The disk cache works by saving the data to the user's SD card.

Furthermore: its connection with the web service is smart. Dumbledroid only opens a connection and checks the headers. If the web service's version wasn't modified since the last time Dumbledroid downloaded it, the framework will use the cached version.

##Usage
You can find a whole working example on the `DumbledroidExample` folder of this repository. It's a working Android project that uses the Dumbledroid framework. But for the purposes of this manual, following are step by step instructions.

###Step 1: Add the framework to your Android project

#### *Using Android Studio?*
Add this to your project's `build.gradle`:

    repositories {
        maven { url 'http://leocad.io/mvn' }
    }
    
    dependencies {
	    compile 'io.leocad:dumbledroid:1.0'
	}

#### *Using Eclipse?*
You can do this in two different ways: importing the Dumbledroid project on Eclipse and [referencing it as a library project](https://developer.android.com/tools/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject) or simply copying the binary file (.jar) to the `libs` directory of your Android project. You can find the latest binary on the "Current Version" paragraph of this document.

###Step 2: Add the permissions to your AndroidManifest.xml
Dumbledroid requires the following permissions to work:

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />

The `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` is optional and is used by the disk cache.

###Step 3: Generate (or write) your classes
Dumbledroid has its own Eclipse plugin to generate the classes from a URL. Unfortunately, there is no plugin for Android Studio just yet. If you're using Android Studio, [skip this part](#android-studio).

If you use Eclipse, you can find instructions on how to install the plugin [here](https://github.com/leocadiotine/Dumbledroid/wiki/Installing-eclipse-plugin).

After installing it, go to the `File > New > Other…` menu and select `Dumbledroid Model file`.

Then, just paste the URL for the JSON or XML, tweak the settings and *aparecium*! You're done!

If you want to manually write your classes, you'll need to create the fields that correspond to your JSON or XML document.

<a name="android-studio"></a>

For example, if you have a JSON like this:

    {
    	"name": "Luke",
    	"surname": "Skywalker",
    	"age": 18,
    	"isFromDarkSide": false,
    	"averageShipSpeed": 138.46
    }

You'll need to write a class like this:

    public class Jedi extends AbstractModel {
        
    	private String name;
    	private String surname;
    	private int age;
    	private boolean isFromDarkSide;
    	private double averageShipSpeed;
    
    	public Jedi() {
    		super("YOUR_JSON_URL");
    	}
    	
    	@Override
    	protected DataType getDataType() {
    		return DataType.JSON;
    	}
    }

The names of the class fields should be exactly the names of the JSON nodes. The class must extend `AbstractModel`, provide an URL in the constructor and return `DataType.JSON` or `DataType.XML` in the `getDataType()` method.

Feel free to make the fields public or to write getters and setters. Dumbledroid doesn't care about that.

###Step 4: Call Dumbledroid from within your Activity (or Context)
After that, you'll just need to do this:

    Jedi jedi = new Jedi();
    jedi.load();

That's it. Your JSON is already parsed and mapped to the Jedi instance. If you enabled caching, Dumbledroid already took care of that for you. Simple, isn't it?

*Note: make sure to call `load()` from a background thread, or [your app can crash](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/perf-anr.html).*
